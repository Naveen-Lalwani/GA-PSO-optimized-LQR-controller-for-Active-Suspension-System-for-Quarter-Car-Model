FitnessFunc.m represents the optimization function that I have developed which is solved using the AI based algorithms like PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithms).

FitnessFunc_ITAE.m & FitnessFunc_ISE.m contains the ITAE (Integral Time-weighted Absolute Error) and ISE (Integral Square Error) objective functions.

PSO_Code.m contains the main Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm code.

PSO_Parameters_Main.m is the main file that should be run for obtaining the results. The objective functions can be changed here and the parameters/ hyperparameters for PSO can be changed here.
